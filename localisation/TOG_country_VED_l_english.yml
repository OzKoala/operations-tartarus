 VED_infantry_fighting_vehicles:0 "Infantry Fighting Vehicles"
 VED_infantry_fighting_vehicles_desc:0 "Tanks usually only have anti-armor weapons. If we make a modified tank that is equipped with machine guns rather than AT-guns, then we can tear into infantry battalions with little resistance!"
 VED_barracksonwheels:0 "Barracks-on-Wheels"
 VED_barracksonwheels_desc:0 "Our drivers are becoming attached to their vehicles. So much so that many give them nick names. We can use this attachment to our advantage.
