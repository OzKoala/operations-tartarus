####EPIC SICKLECLAW SUBMOD GAMING LOC :flushed:####
#### FOCI ####
SRS_finishing_touches:0 "Final Reforms"
SRS_finishing_touches_desc:0 "Despite his initial support for the idea of a General Congress, Sickleclaw has begun spreading a more radical idea. His followers - mostly the personnel of the frontier militia and many internationalist thinkers - are clamouring for the delayment of the Congress until the liberation of Griffenheim under Sickleclaw's leadership - when the revolution is safe from reaction."
SRS_sickleclaw_betrays_congress:0 "The Power-grab"
SRS_sickleclaw_betrays_congress_desc:0 "Sickleclaw seems to have become emboldened by support for him. Only one spark is needed for the powderkeg to explode, and that spark will be Sickleclaw announcing his takeover."
SRS_sickleclaw_obeys_congress:0 "Transition of Power"
SRS_sickleclaw_obeys_congress_desc:0 "Despite a sizeable support base for a permanent Sickleclaw government, comrade Asper has no intentions of refusing to step down. All power to the Congress!"
SRS_civwar_battle_1:0 "The Battle for Ostfloy"
SRS_civwar_battle_1_desc:0 "The first campaign of the war - the Ostfloy Campaign - resulted in negligible casualties on both sides and Sickleclaw's assertion of control over Ostfloy."
SRS_civwar_battle_2:0 "Combat in the Delta"
SRS_civwar_battle_2_desc:0 "Sickleclaw's army isn't the only force fighting for the "toppling" of the congress. Many skirmishes between pro-Sickleclaw and pro-Congress militias occured during the civil war in and around the city, albeit those more resembled the situation in Fezera than an actual war."
SRS_civwar_battle_3:0 "Up the Little Griff"
SRS_civwar_battle_3_desc:0 "Mountain warfare is quite a grueling ordeal. While Sickleclaw's regular formations are duking it out with the mostly untrained pro-Congress forces, the bulk of Sickleclaw's elite will be delegated to rooting out resistance in the Little Griff mountain range."
SRS_civwar_battle_4:0 "The City is Ours!"
SRS_civwar_battle_4_desc:0 "The pro-Sickleclaw forces are now to head into the city. It will be painful for Asper to see the city in such a state of disrepair due to the urban skirmishes, but it is neccessary for Skynavia to survive as a socialist nation."
SRS_civwar_battle_5:0 "Into the Forest"
SRS_civwar_battle_5_desc:0 "The last stronghold of the pro-Congress forces is Bluffhead. It will be a treacherous path to the settlement, with primitivists and guerillas haunting these woods."
SRS_civwar_end:0 "Successful Pacification"
SRS_civwar_end_desc:0 "It had to be done. Sickleclaw took over, and will undoubtedly honour his promises of establishing the congress when the revolution has been truly secured. He will now make an effort to earn back the trust of the people by guaranteeing all rights the Skynavian citizen holds dear."
SRS_national_security:0 "A Matter of National Security"
SRS_national_security_desc:0 "The commotion here and its result had surely attracted attention to us. We should be wary of a potential infiltration from Cloudbury. An invasion from the north in this time of strife is Kemerskai's worst nightmare, and he ought to do anything to prevent such scenario."
SRS_communist_asper:0 "The Fight Rages On"
SRS_communist_asper_desc:0 "Let it be known: comrade Sickleclaw will never betray the workers and peasants of Griffonia! Skynavia stands alone in the sea of monarchism, fascism and ruthless capitalism it found itself in, and will make an effort to drain that sea!"
SRS_conscript_army:0 "Bolster the Ranks"
SRS_conscript_army_desc:0 "Sickleclaw's ideas require a strong military to break free from the reactionary powers that surround our young socialist state. As long as it gives more numbers, it goes. The only option off the table is total conscription, at least for now."
SRS_rev_mil_soviet:0 "Ratify the Sickleclaw Constitution"
SRS_rev_mil_soviet_desc:0 "The Sickleclaw Constitution of 1007 strips Sickleclaw of powers most dictators would defend with their very lives. Two legislative bodies are to be established: the Revolutionary Military Council, and the Civilian Representative Congress, both limited to modifying their respective aspects of Skynavian society."
SRS_defend_the_revolution:0 "For the Defense of the Revolution"
SRS_defend_the_revolution_desc:0 "We cannot let the evil capitalists crush our revolution, not in battle, nor in the "Unsichtbaren Front". As much as it hurts the core libertarian values of the Skyanvian citizen, an intelligence service must be established, for our own good."
SRS_avenge_986:0 "Avenge 986"
SRS_avenge_986_desc:0 "The 986 Act For The Salvation Of The Republic, giving Kemerskai an underclawed victory against Sickleclaw, was the catalyst for the second march north. Where are they now? The Cloudburian citizen is at the risk of famine, in poverty, and his tax idols are usurped by corrupt politicians. The Republican authority in Cloudbury has been delcared an illegitimate state, and war is inevitable."
SRS_ntrwar_commie:0 "The Delayed Pacification"
SRS_ntrwar_commie_desc:0 "First step towards breaking the siege is pacifying the tribes who are currently hostile towards us. With them out of the picture, we can srike our southern neighbours while their guard is down."
SRS_far_north_republic:0 "The Far Northern Republic"
SRS_far_north_republic_desc:0 "There is no doubt that we are to face furious resistance in the event of annexation of tribal territory. Therefore, we shall establish the Far Northern Republic, a native rule government, in total obedience to us. At the moment, no consctruction projects will take place within the territory of the FNR, to respect the anti-modernity sentiment of the local populace."
SRS_commie_yeetvedina:0 "The End of an Era"
SRS_commie_yeetvedina_desc:0 "Feudalism is one of the greatest evils our revolution has to face. Despite harmonic ideals, the Vedinian system hasn't changed for the entire existence of the Kingdom. Therefore, we are to free the people, and try the former masters for the crimes against the feudal bondsgriffs."
SRS_north_united:0 "The Crimson North"
SRS_north_united_desc:0 "What Kemerskai, nor the decentralized commune of old hadn't been able to accomplish has been, well, just made a reality by comrade Sickleclaw. Uniting the north is just the beginning, though..."
SRS_conscription_reform:0 "Recruitment Policy Reform"
SRS_conscription_reform_desc:0 "With the siege broken, we can affort sending a large chunk of our military griffonpower and ponypower back home. These losses should also be replaced with fresh and enthusiastic recruits from Vedina and Cloudbury."
SRS_economic_reform:0 "Socialist Economic Reform"
SRS_economic_reform_desc:0 "We must make an effort to help the ailing people of Vedina and Cloudbury to recover from their barbaric economic policies that favour the privileged classes. Only then we shall expect to compete with the somehow-recovering Empire."
SRS_education_reform:0 "Socialist Education Reform"
SRS_education_reform_desc:0 "We can accelerate the removal of the anti-communist dogma by educating the illiterate people of Vedina and Cloudbury with a curriculum specifically tailored for indocrination. "
SRS_kemerskai_fate:0 "Kemerskai's Fate"
SRS_kemerskai_fate_desc:0 "Traitors always reap what they sow, and Kemerskai is not an exception. The Revolutionary Miliatry Council shall debate on what to do with that rat."
SRS_commie_yeetbrantbeak:0 "Pacify the Mountains"
SRS_commie_yeetbrantbeak_desc:0 "In the mountainous north, there is not a richer mountain range than Brantbeak. By taking it, we would deny capitalists resources, and secure our eastern flank from potential Imperial onslaught."
SRS_on_to_griffenheim:0 "On to Griffenheim!"
SRS_on_to_griffenheim_desc:0 "With our power in the north consolidated, we can withstand a strike from the Kaiser, and perhaps even take the fight to him."
SRS_great_patriotic_war:0 "The Great Revolutionary War"
SRS_great_patriotic_war_desc:0 "We are confident, with our growing popular support and military strengh, that we shall bring an end to the decadent Empire, and liberate its working class citizens from the seemingly eternal oppressive bondage of the Grover dynasty and their lackeys."
SRS_road_of_pragmatism:0 "Road of Pragmatism"
SRS_road_of_pragmatism_desc:0 "Idealism has gained nothing for Skynavia for many years. The revolutionary zeal has to give way to a more reasoned approach at some point or the cycle of internal conflict is sure to continue in perpetuity. Exporting the revolution also needs to be reexamined since Skynavia has scarcely survived the past twenty years."
SRS_heal_the_scars:0 "Heal The Scars"
SRS_heal_the_scars_desc:0 "Like an illness, political healing needs a prescription that the patient will willingly take and accept that the therapy will be hard work."
SRS_new_life_initiative:0 "New Life Initiative"
SRS_new_life_initiative_desc:0 "A proposed solution is ready to be published as a booklet for the masses to read. It should buy the party enough time to stabilise the country for a while. The concept of market socialism will help win back our dissenting youth whilst reassuring the traditionalists that free enterprise will not run amok."
SRS_fortress_skynavia:0 "Fortress Skynavia"
SRS_fortress_skynavia_desc:0 "Concrete bunkers and emplacements will not only deter an invader, but allow the people’s army to inflict great damage upon those who would interrupt our recovery efforts. The first phase of this strategy is to cover the capital from all approaches as recent history has shown how easily the city can be contested and thus jeopardise campaigns away from home."
SRS_border_fortification:0 "Border Fortification"
SRS_border_fortification_desc:0 "Now that the city can be easily held with just the local militias if need be, concerns about holding the border must be addressed. For now, a thin string of bunkers will reassure the rural population that we won’t abandon them and show our enemies that we are no longer a broken nation."
SRS_lil_griff_anti_monarchist_rampart:0 "Little Griff Anti-Monarchist Rampart"
SRS_lil_griff_anti_monarchist_rampart_desc:0 "The current military consensus is that Vedina may see our recent weaknesses as a fine adventure for their foolish young Princess to embark upon. With their strengthened defence line, the people shall say “You shall not pass!”"
SRS_bro_anti_capitalist_rampart:0 "Braunles Anti-Capitalist Rampart"
SRS_bro_anti_capitalist_rampart_desc:0 "Our old rival has suffered just as much instability as we have and Kemerskai’s squabbling warlords may exploit it to their own advantage. However, their armies are forever battling bandits, each other and tribesponies, so a strengthened defence line is sure to deter them from looking outwards."
SRS_dinkau_wall:0 "Dinkau Wall"
SRS_dinkau_wall_desc:0 "All of these bunkers on land will be compromised if the enemy bypasses them with an amphibious landing. Therefore the coasts shall be guarded with permanent artillery emplacements and pillboxes."
SRS_stalliongrad_cooperation:0 "Stalliongrad Cooperation"
SRS_stalliongrad_cooperation_desc:0 "Skynavia now commands a coalition of socialism in the north. Perhaps Stalliongrad will finally take notice of us, because even if our systems differ, our enemies do not. A trading deal and general cooperation would be immensely beneficial to both sides even if a full alliance is not possible."
SRS_workers_tour_of_duty:0 "Worker’s Tour of Duty"
SRS_workers_tour_of_duty_desc:0 "The solution to committing more griffons to Stalliongrad’s cause with a lower risk is to send groups of engineers and workers to run the factories. Those who volunteer will be rewarded with a Worker’s Tour of Duty medal to show their commitment. If we activate this program, Stalliongrad industrialists will offer us some of their designs and documentation for modern factories."
SRS_pan_socialist_tech_exchange:0 "Pan-Socialist Technology Exchange"
SRS_pan_socialist_tech_exchange_desc:0 "In recognition of our contributions to Stalliongrad’s cause, a joint research committee is to be formed so that our nations can exchange and collaborate on mutually beneficial projects."
SRS_collective_mining_effort:0 "Collective Mining Effort"
SRS_collective_mining_effort_desc:0 "Neither side has enough specialist materials such as bauxite for aluminium production and chromium, a necessary ingredient for high quality weapons and armour. It would be advisable to combine our efforts with Stalliongrad’s surveyors to prospect both countries at once for what we mutually need."
SRS_turhamn_pact:0 "Turhamn Pact"
SRS_turhamn_pact_desc:0 "The satellite states are forming new armies that will be seconded to the Skynavian Supreme Command to form a unified defence of socialism. This pact of mutual economic cooperation and defence will be signed in Turhamn to underline the fact that Skynavia implicitly trusts its socialist partners."
SRS_unlikely_membership:0 "Unlikely Membership"
SRS_unlikely_membership_desc:0 "Whilst Skynavia is a growing regional power, we cannot take on the Empire on our own. It is time to set aside our differences and ally with the Republic against a far greater enemy... for now."
SRS_revise_the_sickleclaw_doctrine:0 "Revise the Sickleclaw Doctrine"
SRS_revise_the_sickleclaw_doctrine_desc:0 "Our position is far better than it was just a few years ago. We have reliable and prosperous satellite states fueling the Turnham Pact’s economy to the point that our previously unreachable prize is in reach again: Cloudbury. We must seize the opportunity to liberate it before Kemerskai and his warlords finish consolidating his republic into a real war machine."
SRS_settle_the_score:0 "Settle the Score"
SRS_settle_the_score_desc:0 "We have prevailed with the help of an old enemy against the ultimate threat. It is now time to permanently end the animosity by the pen or sword."
SRS_detente:0 "Detente"
SRS_detente_desc:0 "The war to defeat the Empire has been long and costly. It is also majority occupied by other forces who are unwilling to grant us territory. As such, it is time to formally warm up relations with the Republic so that a lasting peace can be reached that will benefit everyone."
SRS_oil_trading:0 "Oil Trading"
SRS_oil_trading_desc:0 "The demand for oil is higher than ever before as nations build up great industrial bases. Our former enemy is thirsty for this stuff and we are thirsty for income to improve our society. See where this is going?"
SRS_reopen_border:0 "Reopen the Border"
SRS_reopen_border_desc:0 "Both the Turhamn Pact and Griffonian Republic have resources the other is hungry for. We have plenty of raw materials to mine and they have far superior agricultural production. Customs agencies are to be expanded so that goods may flow back and forth without delay."
SRS_trade_deal:0 "Trade Deal"
SRS_trade_deal_desc:0 "There are a variety of agreements in place to facilitate trading with Cloudbury to the point it is becoming complicated. Delegates should be sent out at once to create a single trade deal to cover everything in a more centralised manner."
SRS_northern_rail_network:0 "New Northern Rail Link"
SRS_northern_rail_network_desc:0 "Since the border has opened up, the volume of traffic is becoming too much to handle for both side’s rail and highway network. A joint investment is the answer to this and another sign of peace between our two nations."
SRS_lil_griff_treaty:0 "Little Griff Treaty"
SRS_lil_griff_treaty_desc:0 "All of this progress towards peace will be meaningless if mutual recognition of borders and states are not codified into a solid treaty. Let’s resolve the issue once and for all so that the next decade will not see the continent torn asunder by another series of bloody and destructive wars."
SRS_skynavia_versus_the_forces_of_evil:0 "Turhamn Pact goes on a Crusade"
SRS_skynavia_versus_the_forces_of_evil_desc:0 "The Turhamn Pact is stronger than ever before now that our old rival has become a trusted friend. But our work is not yet done, there are so many threats to the world that we are in a position to deal with, especially those that Stalliongrad have an interest in defeating. We have representatives ready to send abroad with our propositions to reshape the world for the better."
SRS_operation_eclipse:0 "Operation Eclipse"
SRS_operation_eclipse_desc:0 "Cloudbury is ours! The dream is alive bar the blemish that is the Sunstriker Clan. Operation Eclipse is the answer to a problem that Kemerskai failed to resolve."
SRS_cloudbury_anti_imperialism_rampart:0 "Cloudbury Anti-Imperialism Rampart"
SRS_cloudbury_anti_imperialism_rampart_desc:0 "The Turnhamn Pact has reached the very limits of how far we can expand. It is time to expand on the existing fortifications that will be renamed appropriately. From these bunkers, the Empire will bleed itself white trying to crush the socialist dream."
SRS_sunstriker_anti_imperialism_rampart:0 "Brantbeak Redout"
SRS_sunstriker_anti_imperialism_rampart_desc:0 "Brantbeak is already a readily defensible position thanks to its rugged mountains, but it will become even more rugged when the enemy is ambushed by hidden bunkers at every chokepoint."
SRS_air_and_radar:0 "Air Defence"
SRS_air_and_radar_desc:0 "Fortifications are not enough to turn back an invader. Control of the skies will be crucial in further negating the numerical advantage of the Imperial Army. To do this efficiently, a string of airfields with brand new radar systems will let our planes accurately predict where the intruders will be."
SRS_integrate_brantbeak:0 "Integrate Brantbeak"
SRS_integrate_brantbeak_desc:0 "Bandits and an insurgency are hindering efforts to reconstruct Brantbeak’s embracing of socialism. These counterrevolutionaries must be routed so the workers may be free of their terrorist tactics."
SRS_cloudbury_under_socialism:0 "Cloudbury Under Socialism"
SRS_cloudbury_under_socialism_desc:0 "Whereas Brantbeak has an insurgency problem, Cloudbury is more welcoming of our ideology but is instead weighed down by an issue of bilingualism and strong ethnic identity. Care must be taken to prevent pride blinding everyone to reason."
SRS_billingualism_act:0 "Bilingualism Act"
SRS_billingualism_act_desc:0 "Now that the regional government is functional, congress can pass and effectively enact a bill to ensure that Cloudburian speaking griffons will be treated equally. It will go a long way to winning over those who are restless and feeling marginalised."
SRS_consolidate_our_position:0 "Consolidate our Position"
SRS_consolidate_our_position_desc:0 "Skynavia has grown into a larger nation than we ever imagined! Having our seat of government so far away from our most populous region is not practical, therefore we will be transferring the capital to Cloudbury, the beating heart of northern socialism."
SRS_form_the_union_of_griffonian_socialist_states:0 "Form the UGSS"
SRS_form_the_union_of_griffonian_socialist_states_desc:0 "The name ‘Skynavia’ is no longer a terribly inclusive one given the size of our territory. It is time to fully embrace our new identity and reforms by proclaiming the Union of Griffonian Socialist States! Glory to the triumphant revolution!"
SRS_prywhen_cooperation:0 "Prywhen Cooperation"
SRS_prywhen_cooperation_desc:0 "Skynavia now commands a coalition of socialism in the north, so now Prywhen will be receptive to our influence and assistance as they too seek to build a socialist bloc of their own."
SRS_socialism_abroad:0 "Socialism Abroad"
SRS_socialism_abroad_desc:0 "The extent of Skynavia’s direct control of Griffonia has been reached for the foreseeable future, but there is a great deal to be done for the socialist cause abroad as our time with Prywhen has shown. Many countries will welcome foreign intervention in their conflicts even if our ideologies clash, so we shall send them our champions of socialism to show them the way forward."
SRS_prywhen_joint_army_training:0 "Art of War"
SRS_prywhen_joint_army_training_desc:0 "The rough and hardy griffons of Prywhen are experts of living off the land and operating in miserable conditions. Some unlucky officers will be selected to go and romp around Prywhen to experience this for themselves so they can pass it on to their troops who will surely adore them for this. We’ll even teach Prywhen a few things about our own ways of warfare too."
SRS_propaganda_machine_goes_brrrt:0 "Power of The Printed Word"
SRS_propaganda_machine_goes_brrrt_desc:0 "Comrade Redglad has done a lot to unify and strengthen his cause through the written word. His propaganda minister also knows how to keep griffons who are living in near-famine conditions to keep marching and resist the urge to be selfish. We could use some of that inspiration as well. In exchange, we will pay Prywhen with canned food in recognition of their heroic struggle in famine conditions."
SRS_the_sickleclaw_doctrine:0 "The Sickleclaw Doctrine"
SRS_the_sickleclaw_doctrine_desc:0 "Dreams of exporting the revolution to Cloudbury and beyond are not a realistic prospect after Skynavia itself almost collapsed in on itself. The answer to the long-term survival of northern socialism is to liberate the oppressed peoples of countries that can be swiftly invaded and become useful satellite states. "
SRS_operation_toppler:0 "Operation Toppler"
SRS_operation_toppler_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Vedina is ripe for revolution. Its peasants have no rights, no future and the nobility hoard their wealth. A sudden strike could topple the monarchy and grant us grateful new workers, farmland and industry. Controlling so much territory will be too costly and difficult to govern, so once victory is attained, a new socialist state will be run by worthy Vedinan socialists in our stead."
SRS_vedinian_economic_plan:0 "Vedinian Economic Plan"
SRS_vedinian_economic_plan_desc:0 "The Socailist Republic of Vedina has been liberated in the midst of economic development that must be redirected for the benefit of the people. A team of economists and engineers will be sent to direct it along market socialist lines."
SRS_vedinian_bounty:0 "Northern Bounty"
SRS_vedinian_bounty_desc:0 "Now that the economy is functioning correctly, resources can now be tapped and exploited to the mutual benefit of all northern socialists."
SRS_operation_evergreen:0 "Operation Evergreen"
SRS_operation_evergreen_desc:0 "The tribes are at a crossroads where their commoners would be very open to socialism if it spells the end of their oppressive nobility. Outright conquest will result in a continuation of the perpetual insurgency of previous decades, so tribesponies with the right kind of mindset will rule in our stead until their society becomes more industrialized."
SRS_tame_the_wilderness:0 "Tame the Wilderness"
SRS_tame_the_wilderness_desc:0 "The tribal regions have rarely known permanent roads, let alone the railway. Let us fix that and join with our little ponies of the north. Alongside this light infrastructure, a small industrial base will help introduce them to socialism on a scale they can comprehend."
SRS_tribal_auxiliaries:0 "Tribal Auxiliaries"
SRS_tribal_auxiliaries_desc:0 "It is not the right time to fully industrialise the tribes, but the constant border conflicts of previous years has shown that they have a warrior ethos that can be harnessed as their contribution to socialism."
SRS_knak_lil_anti_capitalist_rampart:0 "Knäktberg-Little Griff Anti-Capitalist Rampart"
SRS_knak_lil_anti_capitalist_rampart_desc:0 "Vedina shares a border with our old enemy. It would be far easier to hold if the riverbank was studded with bunkers and emplacements that will fill our socialist brothers with confidence knowing that we won’t abandon them in times of war."
SRS_operation_collective:0 "Operation Collective"
SRS_operation_collective_desc:0 "These islands of scum and villainy are ripe for the taking and many other countries agree. If we could liberate them from fascist claws, Skynavia’s influence on the shipping lanes would be greatly beneficial to us. As an added bonus there are claims of oil reserves that will be worth investigating."
SRS_the_people_flying_circus:0 "The People’s Flying Circus"
SRS_the_people_flying_circus_desc:0 "Shameless arms dealers provided Meyer with his airborne pirate fleet. The sheer variety of designs we’re going to receive will be beneficial to our design bureaus, while it will be a pain to train our pilots to not shoot at these new designs in our inventory."
SRS_fortress_haukland:0 "Fortress Haukland"
SRS_fortress_haukland_desc:0 "Like the rest of our socialist states, the Hauklands will be threatened by Imperialist interests who would stand to gain a great deal from seizing the islands. Coastal artillery is the answer to holding off an invader until help arrives, or better yet, deter an invasion altogether."
SRS_operation_colonist:0 "Operation Colonist"
SRS_operation_colonist_desc:0 "Who said that the northern expansion had to be limited to one continent? Imagine being able to project Skynavian socialism’s influence to Equus. Our brothers and sisters there would be eternally grateful to be lifted from the poverty created by unrestricted capitalism."
SRS_nova_griffonia_development_initiative:0 "Nova Griffonia Development Initiative"
SRS_nova_griffonia_development_initiative_desc:0 "The sad state of Nova Griffonia’s industry must be addressed at once, or else the downtrodden workers will never know the prosperity of market socialism. Industrialisation will be spread out in order to show to all griffons that we will not favour the urbanites over the rural regions."
SRS_nova_griffonian_shinies:0 "Nova Griffonian Shinies"
SRS_nova_griffonian_shinies_desc:0 "The economy of our newest socialist ally is recovering to the point that it can start exploiting untapped natural resources; then Nova Griffonia will truly enjoy the benefits of Skynavia’s superior economic system."
SRS_seasonal_workers:0 "Seasonal Workers"
SRS_seasonal_workers_desc:0 "Unemployment will still be an issue in our system despite our best efforts, but this can temporarily be eased by offering citizens from our fellow socialist states a chance to work for a few months in Skynavia’s understaffed factories and construction crews."
SRS_industrialization_effort:0 "Industrialization Effort"
SRS_industrialization_effort_desc:0 "Skynavia is lagging behind in industrial innovations. We shall look to cooperate with our Severyan comrades in order to compete with the Cloudburians and Imperials."
SRS_internationalist_industrialization:0 "The Internationalist Plan"
SRS_internationalist_industrialization_desc:0 "We cannot spare time appeasing radical enviromentalists with compromises. We will make New Skynavia into the arsenal of socialism in no time."
SRS_unfinished_urban_projects:0 "Unfinished Urban Projects"
SRS_unfinished_urban_projects_desc:0 "It's the same story every time: internationalists want to build a centralized arms factory, it gets finished half-way, then the communalists go ahead and stall the project, letting the unfinished factory take up the little space we have. Now that the internationalists don't have a leash, it's nigh time to finish construction of these buildings for the good of the Skynavian people."
SRS_industry_dinkau:0 "Develop Dinkau"
SRS_industry_dinkau_desc:0 "We are to incorporate the local industry of Dinkau into our country, reaping its benefits. With the aforementioned local industry, we are able to further develop the region."
SRS_industry_bluffhead:0 "Develop Bluffhead"
SRS_industry_bluffhead_desc:0 "Bluffhead is very developed for a far-northern settlement. By incorporating the settlement's limited industrial capability with our own, we can turn the settlement into a prosperous city."
SRS_urban_education:0 "Military Research Centre"
SRS_urban_education_desc:0 "More war is on the horizon and we need the best intellect we have to be focused upon it. This can be done by pulling some expertise from the civilian sector and concentrating them in a new institute - it will impact civilian projects, but the state and the military agree that it would be a worthwhile cost in the long run."
SRS_interconnectedness:0 "The Infrastructure Project"
SRS_interconnectedness_desc:0 "What purpose do the vast industrial complexes of our nation serve, when there is no transportation network to bring the fruits of labour where they are needed? We will remedy our lack of infrastructure post-haste!"
SRS_sweet_oil:0 "The Ostfloy Oil Deposit"
SRS_sweet_oil_desc:0 "As a communist country, we cannot easily acquire the resources we need from the international market. Oil is one such resource, important for civilian lives and war machines alike. Fortunately, Ostfloy is rich in oil, and we shall get to extracting it for the good of the revolution."
SRS_stalliongrad_mining_equipment:0 "Severyan Mining Equipment"
SRS_stalliongrad_mining_equipment_desc:0 "Our mining equipment is woefully inadequate. In exchange for assisting Severyana with raw resources, we are to acquire the most modern mining equipment to increase output from the Braunles and the Little Griff mountains mining operations."
SRS_stalliongrad_education_aid:0 "Severyan Education Aid"
SRS_stalliongrad_education_aid_desc:0 "In true communist solidarity, hundreds of Severyan volunteer teachers are going to the rural communes inland, and teaching our rural population. We should fully endorse and support this endeavour. The results beckon!"
SRS_communalist_industrialization:0 "The Communalist Appeasement Plan"
SRS_communalist_industrialization_desc:0 "We must preserve the land for generations to come. Unrestricted industralization might arm our comrades, but we need to put into account what happens afterwards..."
SRS_link_up_communes:0 "Link up the Communes"
SRS_link_up_communes_desc:0 "The idea of mutual aid is nigh-impossible without a working infrastructure system. Obivously, we need to engage in a mass-scale construction to make our comrades in the rural communes prosper!"
SRS_small_scale_dinkau:0 "Aid Dinkau Development"
SRS_small_scale_dinkau_desc:0 "Contacting the previously uncontacted settlers of Dinkau is going to allow us to reap the benefits of their local fishing industry. Their contribution to the mutual aid program would be used to feed communes further inland."
SRS_small_scale_bluffhead:0 "Aid Bluffhead Development"
SRS_small_scale_bluffhead_desc:0 "Bluffhead harbours a sizeable lumber industry, and will contribute a huge part of it towards the mutual aid program. Our comrades in the city won't be freezing with cozy fires in their homes. "
SRS_one_big_union:0 "One Big Union!"
SRS_one_big_union_desc:0 "Fascists harness the will of their citizens that they decieved and turn the country into one big factory. We have a sacred duty to counteract the scum. Our nation will turn into one big union, ready to withstand the test of time."
SRS_consolidated_gunmakers_union:0 "Consolidated Gunmakers' Union"
SRS_consolidated_gunmakers_union_desc:0 "There are dozens of independent minor gunmakers in both urban and rural communities. Organizing all of them under the "Consolidated Gunmakers' Union" as a sort of a military-industrial complex will help pour equipment into the fight against the reactionary forces."
SRS_mass_unionization:0 "Mass Consolidation"
SRS_mass_unionization_desc:0 "Industries in the rural areas are spread out far and between. With our experiment of consolidating gunmakers proving a success, we shall do the same with the civilian aspects of the economy."
SRS_further_industrialization:0 "Further Industrialization"
SRS_further_industrialization_desc:0 "We are on the road to turning New Skynavia into a beacon of civilization in the extreme North. Now that our society is not as divided as before, it is time to fully industrialize the brave North!"
SRS_inland_industry:0 "Inland Industrial Development"
SRS_inland_industry_desc:0 "Until now, only New Skynavia proper, Dinkau, and Bluffhead bore the brunt of industrial development. To keep the population of Braunles and Ostfloy away from migrating en-masse to the big cities, we shall develop those two provinces, so that they are stars of the north, shining alongside New Skynavia."
SRS_military_industry_focus:0 "Arsenal of Socialism"

SRS_breathe_skynavia_desc:0 "New Skynavia is a grim place to live in. Grey high-rise buildings, which made up the bulk of the living space of the city were not a beautiful sight. Now, that we are not obstructed by austere radicals, our citizens will take to the streets and make the city beautiful."

SRS_forest_industry_desc:0 "In 1005, an attempt was made to bolster Skynavian military industry by building an arsenal in Bluffhead. Not only it failed, but the unfinished building also was the centre of attention of a siege during the civil war.

SRS_stage_two:0 "Stage Two"
SRS_stage_two_desc:0 "The time has come to tone down the mutual aid program and push our country's industry to new limits.

SRS_ostfloy_infrastructure:0 "Roads to the Black Gold"

Our Aquileian comrades remember it well, and the phrase "Ils Ne Passeront Pas!", their warcry, will be universally adopted amongst every single creature serving in the armed forces, along with their hardy, sometimes suicidal tactics.

srs_sickocivwartwo.0.t:0 "The Ever-Chaotic Congress"
srs_sickocivwartwo.0.d:0 "The room was filled with meaningless shouting. Again. Sickleclaw sighed, and leaned back in his seat as he contemplated just leaving the room for a long scenic walk into the forest. Those foolish congressgriffins all refuse to work together. Not even when the country is burning down to ground around them, and not even for the betterment of griffinkind. The griffs he had to contend with would sooner praise Celestia than actually cooperate. His idealist vision of a congress governing everything was turning sour by the minute.\n\n"We have said this before, and we will say it again: our party will not compromise with those corrupt and immoral griffs who wish to break the ordinary working griff’s body and spirit with those harsh production quotas. It is against the principles of our nation to coerce the workers into harsher and harsher conditions only to prepare them to fight the ponies of the Northern Tribes." A tall, imposing griff said as she shouted across the room to assert dominance. "I hope to never see those wretched and vile ideas proposed within this chamber ever again."\n\n"Ha! And what would you have us do instead? Have ghosts staff our factories?" a short, bespectacled griffin that sat across the other side of the room laughed mirthlessly as he shot Sickleclaw a glare. "Face it! We need even more demanding quotas to reflect the urgent needs our country has in order to get a mediocre parity against our neighbours who would sooner see our revolutionary ideals snuffed out in the night and stranded without a home once again!"\n\n"Well, all I see is beaks opening and closing, quacking like ducks, the lot of you. We could be having the same discussion for another century and no resolution would be reached!" Asper finally said, breaking his silence. He scanned the faces across the room, and all he could see was reluctant agreement. "This deadlock cannot go on for any longer, or we will have created an emergency that all Skynavians will have to deal with while ineffectual politicians flap their wings and shake their beaks behind closed doors. Something must be done. My word, if it has to be me that sort out this mess then so be it."\n\n"If you can pull something together and help the working griffin retain their dignity, then we would be happy to pledge our support." The female griff said, her entire demeanour still radiated displeasure. "And I suppose this will be the cue for some griffin soaring out in disagreement?"\n\n"No, no. In fact, if Comrade Sickleclaw wants to handle everything by his lonesome and save us the trouble, then we are more than happy to oblige." The glasses-wearing griffin drawled sarcastically, his voice dripped with venom as he flapped his wings. "I suppose five months would be a reasonable timeframe to resolve our disagreements on the paths forward for our nation?"\n\n"That would be more than enough." Sickleclaw shot back, "If I hear one more peep out of any of you at the end of this, I promise you that all you will see is one very angry griffon. Are we clear on this?""

This is his responsibility, and he will fix it to the best of his ability. He owed it to his country to do this.\n\nThe latest reports had not brought much good news. He picked up the first report placed on top of the delicate pile of paper and started reading, it wasn’t long before a deep and overwhelming despair welled up inside him.\n\n‘The Republican border won’t hold for much longer,’ He muttered to himself, ‘Those bandits aren’t leaving our troops alone. If we were to leave them unimpeded, then what would that say about us? We would be weak, ineffectual in the face of a border crisis...no, we can’t let this happen.’\n\nOn the other claw, the second report in terms of urgency was in regard to the tribal ponies. They had never stopped fighting them, much to Sickleclaw’s annoyance. In spite of the People’s army being there to placate them, they still attack from the shadows, causing unnecessary death and suffering. Now, a line had truly been crossed. The tribal warbands had taken resistance to another level.\n\nHe closed his eyes. There would be enough resources for him to pursue an investigation into one of the two issues at claw.

Being able to soar on in the night sky made him feel liberated and freed of the chains that threaten to drag him back to the ground again.\n\nBut such a moment is not to last, for he has a purpose. They have to identify the bandit nests that lie somewhere upon the borders of Skynavia, his team has already narrowed it down to a few spots to root them out. Those covert reconnaissance missions will be able to give him an edge over them should it come down to it.\n\nFinally, he touched back down to the ground and saw his comrades hidden out in the forest, deep within the undergrowth, armed to the beak with weapons designed specifically to incapacitate as quickly as possible.\n\n‘There’s a camp about a click downwind, we go in from all sides and overwhelm them before they can mount a defence. Ready?’ He said, and then relayed his commands once again over the radio.\n\nHe watched his griffins all get into position; all possible avenues of escape had been blocked off by now. The bandits are asleep, with only two griffs to stand guard for the entire camp, this will be a piece of cake.\n\nFinally, he gave the signal to go and within moments the entire camp broke out in a flurry of noise and actions as the still-sleepy bandits, to their credit, readied themselves for combat even against overwhelming odds.\n\nSickleclaw grimaced, he underestimated their ability to react to a surprise attack, to be sure, but his forces still hold control and an overwhelming advantage, if he was to approach them now and talk them down...perhaps he could resolve this without firing a single shot. Lives would be saved if they are the cooperative type...but it is obvious that his team held a definitive firepower advantage over those ill-equipped ruffians, why risk trusting those bandits to be better griffs and give them an opportunity to catch his team off guard?\n\nIn the end, he decided to..."

I am here to negotiate an end to this conflict.' Sickleclaw said calmly, 'Put down your weapons. We don’t need to use them for a polite discussion, now, do we?' \n\n'You are a dirty traitor to our revolution. Why should we trust you?' One of the griffins scowled, 'You’ve all got your fancy guns aimed right at us. So if we put our weapons down, how do we know you won’t just shoot us?' \n\n'If I thought there was no chance of establishing a minimal sense of trust, then we would not be having this conversation right now.' Sickleclaw paused and weighed up what he was about to say. 'To me, your lives are just as important to me as the griffins that stand besides me. We are all griffins here, and in-fighting when we could stand united under one common goal sickens me."\n\n"Do you really mean that?' he saw another one of the bandit griffins relax her posture.\n\n'Of course,' Sickleclaw grinned, 'I am committed to bringing fairless to the workers. Now tell me your name.'\n\n'My name is Glinda.' She replied curtly, 'But if you think this will be enough to convince us to lay down our arms, it won’t be enough. We have committed ourselves to the true revolution.'\n\n'The request can become an order, if you like.' Sickleclaw stared her down.\n\n'And why aren’t you putting your weapons down, then?' Glinda asked, 'If you really believe in all of this hoity-toity rhetoric, then put your words where your beak is and we all put our weapons down on the ground.' \n\n'Of course. We will holster our weapons.' Sickleclaw said without hesitation, and ordered his loyal griffins to holster their weapons. 'Now, as a gesture of goodwill, will you agree to continued negotiations?'"

No matter how many times I read through the submitted documentation, I could not believe my very eyes,’ Sickleclaw sighed, ‘I needed to hear this straight from the mouth of the griffons responsible for patrolling this blasted place before I can get my head around how this developed into such a mess.’ \n\nOne of the guards stepped forward, his face masked by a jumble of nerves. He saluted shakily and did his best to report. \n\n‘Comrade Sickleclaw, we did our best to hold against the tribals, but they caught us by surprise. It came like a flash, sir. After it all ended, we examined their tracks and found partially covered hoofprints intermingled with griffon pawprints. It had led us to the only logical conclusion we could derive from this piece of information...there was insider knowledge reaching the tribals, and they are striking at us where it hurts when we are least expecting it, Comrade,’ The soldier said, he stared straight at Sickleclaw, ‘At this point, all of our efforts at the border would be made worthless if they could identify and subvert even the most hidden outposts.’ \n\nSickleclaw massaged his forehead, he felt a headache coming on. On all fronts, they were at a disadvantage, this will not do. The tribesponies had been actively resistant to their efforts to pacify them for many moons, but now it seems as though they have found collaborators to help them in their efforts. \n\nWhile two battalions of troops from the city could end this problem by outnumbering the sympathisers, but diverting these strategic reserves could leave them open to other threats. Either way, he had to make a choice, right here. Sickleclaw decided to..."

He went through a timeline in his mind as he weighed up the value of his two decades of struggle to form the true pan-Griffonian state. The more he brooded over it, the more and more the value slipped like those volatile stock markets of the capitalist world. What haunted him more than his past actions was the fact his power grab felt like a decisive victory already.

The city faced indiscriminate bombardment from the artillery the Congressional forces had captured from abandoned positions during their counterattack. Limited direct combat took place at the outskirts and infiltration teams planted demolition charges in the sewers to collapse roads, but neither side had the strength to strike harder. Supply convoys were also raided in a bid to starve out the city.\n\n“What’s our munition production looking like per week?” Sickleclaw asked a worker’s council leader,\n\n“Not great. Our tooling is older than the griffons working it and we’re getting bogged down in council meetings.”\n\n“Debating more efficient methods, I hope.”\n\n“To a degree, but it's hard to get a majority vote on new methods and how much quality control is needed.”\n\n“Hmm, maybe those young student protestors are right about having a more centralised management system.”\n\nThe council leader was agape.\n\n“But we would still have unions of course.” he hastened to add."

With enthusiasm, the order was given to pursue the shattered counterrevolutionaries into the countryside. Artillery was fired freely since Sickleclaw no longer had any concerns about collateral damage. The sweeping advance shuttered to a halt as the Congressional army’s reserves sprung into action. These fresh reserves caused great dismay and shunted Sickleclaw’s army back into a defensive position only some eight kilometers from their starting point.\nOnce again, Sickleclaw found himself back in his office alone and awaiting new reports. He looked at a map pinned to the wall and eyed up Stalliongrad and his thoughts began to stray towards what a decisive authoritarian leader could do... what he could do... but such thinking was contrary to all that Skynavia stood for!"

The enemy stockpiles were low to begin with and their few factories were just as clunky. His army’s morale began to recover and the prospect of a second breakout became realistic.\n\nTime was against him, so he once again banked on a rapid advance, this time to the eastern border where its porous nature led to tribesponies capitalising on the conflict for their own objectives. Sometimes their attacks would conveniently coincide with the Congressional army’s actions, be it a diversion or a supporting attack clearly avoiding their new friends.\n\nAll the while, Sickleclaw and his officers were concerned that not only the tribes could exploit the situation. If Kemerskai or his warlord rivals got their act together, Skynavia would be rolled up in a matter of weeks, or less if the youth movement welcomed the republicans.\n\nThe proceeding month was agony as his army slowly divided the Congressional Army down into boxes that could be starved into surrendering. Several more pockets saw reason as Sickleclaw twisted the arms of the factory worker’s councils to ramp up production, thus the attrition caused by artillery intensified. Their morale frayed as the Congressional officers began experiencing breakdowns in command as they struggled to reach a consensus on how to link up their regiments again. There were no such cripplingly indecisive arguments in Sickleclaw’s more rigid command structure.\n\nThis ‘Thunder of the Gods’ was enough to cause the tribesponies to slip away across the border, despite the affinity they had gained for modern rifles. With that lifeline severed, the exhausted Congressional Army laid down its arms when Sickleclaw promised them hot soup."

This made him a threat that should be silenced as quickly as possible.\n\nAs he made his way towards his home after a day's worth of teaching soldiers how to shoot straight, he was unexpectedly approached by a griffon and a pony in rather distinct regalia.\n\n"Genosse Joger, good evening.

They had already taken her!\n\n"Of course, comrade..."\n\nThey did not walk far. After reaching a secluded area away from any prying eyes in the night, the lieutenant was ordered to face a wall.

Said the pony, smiling maliciously "I guess you're free to go, then. You survived Severyan roulette with self-loading pistols, but, please, don't make us try a third time."\n\nThe pair of agents made their way from where they had secluded Dominik, whose thoughts were now scrambled to no end.

No wonder none had been found when the Skynavian marines made it ashore!\nDespite the distasteful methods of acquisition, these planes would be repurposed to serve the people.

Many of Stalliongrad’s high-ranking party members had even denounced him for being a traitor to the revolution since he embraced market socialism rather than total state control.\nRegardless, clearly some of them had changed their tune now that Skynavia commanded its own bloc with a booming economy.

With this major sucess towards the completion of the Revolution and one less obstacle towards the true enemy of the workers of Griffonia - the Empire itself - preparations were made to stabilize the recently liberated territories and to implement the "Transitional Rural Economic Policy" - also known as "T.R.E.P." - as a means to help the rural populace accept gradual change from the old order to the new. Despite the small scale capitalism occuring in the rural areas though, the cities are taking the brunt of collectivization efforts, and will inevitably become shining beacons of socialism alongside New Skynavia.\n\nUnfortuantely, this decision upset one of the regional governors - namely the governor of Winghagen - who saw such a measure as a revision of the precepts of the revolution and had been making his complaints known to the central authority.\n\n"Comrade, I am sorry to be calling you at such a late hour, but these new directives are frankly outrageous! How is the Vanguard-Marshal hoping to achieve the objectives of the revolution when he himself is unwilling to fully implement the policies from back home?"\n\nThe voice of the clearly tired Governor-General of Cloudbury spoke to the griffon on the other side of the line - "Comrade, your half-dozen complaints from this week have been dully noted, but this is not a matter of debate. Comrade Sickleclaw knows best and you are to carry out your orders. If I hear one more word from you daring to question the decisions of the central authority I shall have you arrested for treason!

After all, the arch-traitor did not provide such dignity for their defeated enemy when the Republicans took over Cloudbury and indiscriminately killed off the Cloudburian royal family, so why should we?\n\nNow it is them who are going north on paw and claw. Same conditions as our fallen comrades - starvation, the cold, and a native ambushing party if they manage to nearly finish the punishment march.\n\nThe propagandists of the reaction will have a field day with their fate - portraying us as murderers and every other murder-related word in the dictionary - but we will make no excuses for the terror."

For awhile this went on...until things fell silent. He heard some talking, doors opening.. was it the guards?\n\nThen he saw them. The soldiers with the crimson banners. They were going from cell to cell, some shooting the ones inside, but for many more...they were letting the prisoners go.\n\nThe old coot from down the hall ran past his cell, shouting about liberation and freedom.\n\nFreedom.\n\nThat word sounded good right about now... the army wasnt here anymore... all he did was steal food...\n\nHe shouted out to the soldiers in a desperate bid for attention. \n\n"Hey!

Well, the Skynavian people, at least. The Vedinians and Cloudburians will need more time to see the benefits in prolonged co-operation with us.\n\nToday, the Vanguard-Marshal decides either to finally install the General Congress as a governing body of the socialist Republic himself, or exploit the euphoria of the Skynavian people, namely by holding a referendum on this matter that would most certainly result in an outcome in favour of Sickleclaw remaining the Vanguard-Marshal for life, greatly boosting his legitimacy as a leader."

He smiled at the camera crew that had broken out the precious stockpile of colour film and good audio equipment.\n\nHis very serious speech was interrupted when he saw the flag on the domed roof of the final objective get taken down. He howled and cheered and embraced the nearest griffon he could grab.

On trial today were another batch of the Imperial General Staff, the ultimate middle-griffs within the highest ranks of the Imperial hierarchy, the ones who made their orders happen. They sat at a long table in uniforms stripped of all insignia besides a prisoner number. Their expressions ranged from disdain, blank stares and hints of defeatism. All eyes, however, were on Anicetus Mudbeak. He seemed downright relieved to be on trial. He answered question after question without hesitation and each one seemed to lift a weight off his shoulders rather than weigh them down.\n\n“Mister Mudbeak, is it true that the twenty-second corps received explicit orders to commandeer a train full of food intended for a prisoner of war camp known to be dangerously under-provisioned?”\n\n“Yes, your honour.” he said as he opened a folder tagged as evidence, “I was not able to stop those orders, but I stashed away documentation meant to be destroyed when their headquarters in northern Luxwingburg was overrun.”\n\n“Is it true that some two hundred prisoners died of starvation or related illnesses caused by their weakened state?”\n\n“That is correct. No regard was given to the prisoners as the war turned in favour of Skynavian forces-”\n\n“Objection, your honour.” said a polite and stern diamond dog by the name of Haupthetzen Benito, “I interject that defendant Mudbeak is embellishing the story with the sole motivation of seeking a reduced sentence. Some provisions were still delivered and invalids were relocated to hospitals when their situation became critical.”\n\n“My sole motivation is the truth!” Mudbeak said in an uncharacteristically snappy tone, “Yours is mindless loyalty even when it means pointless war!”\n\nIt felt so good to finally say something that had been on his mind for decades\n\n“I again cast doubt on Mudbeak’s credibility. The griffon lacks honour-”\n\n“That’s enough.” the judge waved his gavel at them, “The court will hear all admissible evidence and testimony in due course.”\n\nThe rest of the defendants shrugged, sighed or slouched in their chairs.

#### LEADERS ####
SKYNAVIAN_GENERAL_CONGRESS_NAME:0 "Skynavian General Congress"
SKYNAVIAN_GENERAL_CONGRESS_NAME_DESC:0 "The governing body of the Socialist Republic of Skynavia since its formation, the Skynavian General Congress is made up of 80 delegates representing their respective constituencies. These delegates are nominated from amidst their communities and democratically elected to serve short terms, with each term usually being one-third of a year, and can be re-elected for a maximum of three terms. Because these delegates are responsible for representing the opinions of their electorates they are subject to immediate recall and replacement if the General Congress undertakes decisions unfavourable to their constituency.\n\nThis system of governance ensures that power remains decentralised at the behest of the people by preventing the formation of a politican caste.\n\nAlthough the General Congress is sometimes inefficient due to its delegates all being amateurs at statecraft, the Congress can proudly lay claim to being one of the most democratic institution in all of Griffonia, and perhaps in the entire world as well."
JOHN_CARLINI_NAME_DESC:0 "John Carlini grew up in a rich merchant district in Skyfall, experiencing a pampered childhood provided by his businessgriff father.\n\nGoing to the Cyrusval University in Yale for his higher studies, he became radicalised by the socialist thought prevalent in the University's Faculty of Social Sciences. Thoroughly disillusioned with his bourgeois upbringing, as soon as he graduated he signed up to one of the many mercenary companies fighting in the conflicts flaring up all around the world.\n\nHaving participated in the fierce fighting in the fields of Prywhen on the Communist side, Carlini arrived at the Socialist Republic of Skynavia bringing with him those of his mercenary company he was able to win over to the ideals of socialism. Now, he aspires to fight for a higher cause - that of the liberation of the proletariat of Griffonia."
SICKLECLAW_NAME_DESC:0 "Asper Sickleclaw was a junior lieutenant in the Griffonian army when the First Revolution smashed the Empire to pieces. Marching alongside his fellow revolutionaries, Sickleclaw participated in most of the battles against the monarchist counter-revolution, eventually ending up in Cloudbury along with the remnants of the Republican government.\n\nHaving witnessed the despotism and authoritarianism of the Republican generals, Sickleclaw, anticipating the Republic's spiral into warlordism, adopted socialist views and marched onwards north, leading disillusioned socialists and other leftists away from the crumbling Republic into the virgin lands of Skynavia, where they hoped to start anew, free from the baggage of capitalist militarism.\n\nNow a staunch Internationalist, Sickleclaw is the foremost military leader of the Skynavian Socialist Republic, and is looked up to by most as a revered war hero, though some have raised concerns over what they perceive to be autocratic tendencies in his leadership."
GRANGER_NAME_DESC:0 "An aspiring officer cadet of the Imperial Guard in his youth, Granger turned his back on all the riches of the Griffonian Empire, choosing instead to put his expertise at the service the socialist revolution.\n\nAs with most military leaders in the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, Granger is an avowed Internationalist, as well as being a close friend and ideological ally of Field Marshal Sickleclaw."
PROUDPONE_NAME_DESC:0 "Pierre Ponehon was born in Prance, Equestria, but left his overbearing family at an early age to travel the world. In Griffonia, he got tangled up with the revolutionaries and while initially a mercenary, he adopted the ideals of socialism swiftly and eagerly, even publishing some writings about an own more radical form of anarchist socialism.\n\nHe'll ask Maar for help before he asks Boreas and would serve Nightmare Moon before Celestia: whoever fights the powers that be in the world he will gladly support. After the failed revolution and the flight north he departed to aid other socialist movements around the world. These have included Stalliongrad, Longsword and the Brodfeld Revolutionaries and no matter where he has gone, he has only been more convinced of the need to send the old order crashing down."
GOLDGRIFF_NAME_DESC:0 "Born in Nova Griffonia in 946 as the daughter of a dockworker, Emma Goldgriff was introduced to the works of Caramel Marks and Steel Stallion at an early age and spent some time in Stalliongrad during her younger years. During the revolution of 978 she was already a published author and participated eagerly in the struggle, as well as the retreat.\n\nInstead of remaining in Skynavia, however, she departed after the founding of the socialist republic as she felt she could not sit idly in the north and just write. Since then, she had travelled the world - often undercover - as an author and agitator. She especially has taken an interest in the social aspects of the revolution and is as comfortable leading partisans as she is arguing for revised social norms. "
BEAKUNIN_NAME_DESC:0 "Beakunin is one of the oldest and most influential of the griffonian revolutionaries, called a "father of the revolution" by many of his supporters. Born in the Heartlands of the Griffonian empire, Beakunin was in Equestria on a business trip during the early 950s when he met the legendary Caramel Marks. The sharp-witted young griffon caught Caramel Marks' attention and Beakunin was a quick and attentive learner. He was, however, not a very orthodox student and clashed ceaselessly with the old pony on matters of ideology and method. During the griffonian revolution he was one of the most important leaders and, along with Sickleclaw, was the leader during the retreat north.\n\nHe departed when it was clear the Skynavian Socialist Republic would focus on rebuilding and recovering rather than pursue the expansion of the Socialist Revolution worldwide, and has since then helped train and organize revolutionaries wherever needed. He may be in his eighties, but he will not stop as long as he can move."
HORSON_WELLES_NAME_DESC:0 "Horson Welles began his illustrious career as a socialist revolutionary in his native Equestria, where in his early adulthood he produced numerous groundbreaking films equally revered for their avant-garde creativity and progressive values.\n\nLater he travelled across the ocean to the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, where he could experience and document the griffons' revolutionary struggle firsthoof.\n\nIn his youth, Horson took part in many shooting competitions, and got very good at marksponyship."

Ours is a collectivist ethos, where the good of the collective whole takes precedence over individualist desires.\n\nThis has made our society a bit overbearing, and perhaps we allow our actions to be dictated too much by public opinion, but at least we do all this willingly, in the name of cooperation and kinship."

SRS_commonwealth_special_3_b_desc:0 "Now that most of Griffonia lives free under the aegis of Socialism, it is quite absurd that we continue to uphold the concept of national borders, since we are all citizens of our Socialist Commonwealth; the pre-Commonwealth borders were usually nonsensical and arbitrary anyways. Introducing a Pan-Griffonian passport for all citizens will be the first step in our eradication of nationalism."
SRS_commonwealth_special_3_c:0 "In the Defense of Freedom"
SRS_commonwealth_special_3_c_desc:0 "Ponehon has called, repeatedly, for abolishment of any type of conscription. We cannot build our country on an army of coerced people. Let it instead be built on free creatures who have been taught to fight and who of their own, free volition will fight to protect the people."

SRS_beginning_1:0 "Rally Around the Ideal"
SRS_beginning_1_desc:0 "After we had split from the Republicans in Cloudbury, the constituent factions of the Revolutionary Front have drifted away from each other. We must not forget our founding ideals - liberty, socialism, and revolution - and rekindle the flame of solidarity in the hearts of our people, so we may become great in time."
SRS_beginning_2a:0 "Concessions to the Internationalists"
SRS_beginning_2a_desc:0 "In return for their cooperation, the Internationalists have demanded that the Republic work towards the immediate resolution of the conflict with the Northern Tribes, as well as engagement in future liberatory struggles in neighbouring Vedina and Cloudbury under the leadership of the General Congress."
SRS_beginning_2b:0 "Concessions to the Communalists"
SRS_beginning_2b_desc:0 "Under the terms dictated by the Communalist coalition, the General Congress is obligated to engage in the infrastructural and industrial development of the autonomous Skynavian communes, whilst at the same time respecting their independence from the central government. A rather restrictive arrangement, but we need their support as much as they need ours."
SRS_beginning_3a:0 "Restart Construction"
SRS_beginning_3a_desc:0 "The urbanisation of New Skynavia ground to a halt as the divide between the Internationalists and Communalists grew in the years following the SR Skynavia's establishment. Large swaths of land lie undeveloped, and the city is dotted with incomplete construction projects. A combined effort coordinated by Sickleclaw's staff shall see to the recommencement of development in New Skynavia."
SRS_beginning_3b:0 "Convene the General Congress"
SRS_beginning_3b_desc:0 "It is finally time to make the long-awaited, but never fully realised, concept of a General Congress of the United Socialist Revolutionary Front to the test. With Sickleclaw as interim chairgriffon, the General Congress, staffed by democratically-elected Internationalist and Communalist delegates, will meet in the centre of New Skynavia for their first meeting. Here's to democracy!"
SRS_beginning_3c:0 "Industrial Retooling"
SRS_beginning_3c_desc:0 "Much of Skynavia's industry is based off outdated equipment dating from when the socialists were still allied with Kemerskai. What we have now, whilst subject to enterprising innovation from our scientists and engineers, remains outdated and scattered, and most importantly, woefully meagre. Sickleclaw, with the Revolutionary Front behind him, shall pursue the revitalisation of Skynavian industry."
SRS_beginning_4a:0 "Unite the Communes"
SRS_beginning_4a_desc:0 "A consensus has been reached by the notoriously independent and aloof Communalists that, in order to survive against the reactionary forces massing on our borders, the scattered communes and collectives of Skynavia shall band together for their mutual benefit. The central government is still left with little control over Communalist industry and resources outside of New Skynavia, though."
SRS_beginning_4b:0 "Rein in the Revolutionaries"
SRS_beginning_4b_desc:0 "Ever since we have arrived in Skynavia, the radical Internationalists have been raving to go to war with all our neighbours in the name of the socialist revolution. Their suicidal expansionist tendencies have cooled somewhat since, but with the formation of the General Congress and Sickleclaw's reconciliatory measures, we can finally harness and put their revolutionary ardour to good use."
SRS_beginning_5a:0 "Comradely Cooperation"
SRS_beginning_5a_desc:0 "Although we may not agree with the infuriating indifference displayed by the Hail Forest communes, we recognise that at the end of the day they are still our brothers and sisters. We must seek to work together with them for a nonviolent solution where we will be allowed to conduct troop movements within the forest. This will be a lengthy process but we all trust in the solidarity of the Skynavian people."
SRS_beginning_5b:0 "Reclaiming the Forest"
SRS_beginning_5b_desc:0 "The Hail Forest communes are selfish and individualistic in their refusal to accomodate our defense strategy, to the detriment of the rest of Skynavia. We will tolerate such antisocial behaviour no longer! The ever-decisive Sickleclaw will do the tough thing, and reclaim the forest for the Skynavian people with his loyal soldiers. Many will disagree with our methods, but it is for the greater good."
SRS_beginning_of_the_end:0 "The End of the Beginning"
SRS_beginning_of_the_end_desc:0 "Sickleclaw's reforms are nearing their culmination. Already, the mood in Skynavia is hopeful; with the Revolutionary Front united once more, the Skynavian people can now aspire to greater things. The only thing left to do, then, is for Sickleclaw to step down, formally ceding power to the General Congress. The people of Skynavia shall finally be in full control of their destiny."

SRS_expansion_1a:0 "The Next Generation"
SRS_expansion_1a_desc:0 "The socialist education system that served us in Skynavia so well shall be enjoyed by the children of our neighbour countries as well. We will send volunteer to our neighbours, not only to educate the young griffons and ponies, but to help our friends rebuild their societies in the image of socialism as well. Everyone should take part in this effort, in the spirit of solidarity."
SRS_expansion_1b:0 "Socialist Atomics"
SRS_expansion_1b_desc:0 "Working in concert with scientists from our liberated neighbours, we have begun to unravel the mysteries of the atom, and the power that lie therin. When we finally achieve our breakthroughs, will the godlike power of the split atom be put to use for the good of all creaturekind, or as the hammer of the people against the forces of reaction?"
SRS_expansion_1c:0 "The Crusade Continues"
SRS_expansion_1c_desc:0 "We have consolidated our power sufficiently in the north to plan for the liberation of the Griffonian Heartlands. After decades in exile following the First Griffonian Revolution, the socialists of Skynavia are now faced with the prospect of returning home. Let us set our sights on that penultimate bastion of monarchism, the Imperial City itself, and charge forwards in the name of socialism!"

SRS_elections_timer_desc:0 "Three times each year, free elections are held where the citizens of the Socialist Republic of Skynavia choose a delegate from their midst to represent their community at the General Congress of the USRF. These delegates, who are subject to immediate recall and replacement from their communities, serve on the Congress for a term limited to three election cycles, after which they must step down — that is, if they have managed to retain their position for the three consecutive cycles, which hardly happens.\n\nThe outcome of the elections are mainly based on the decisions of the Internationalists and Communalists in between elections, where over-eager and too-frequent decision-making by either faction alienates those citizens of Skynavia most adversely affected by such decisions, thus loosing them their support.\n\nIt is very rare that either faction secures an overwhelming majority within the General Congress, as various checks and balances serve to maintain a stable power balance where no faction is able to permanently wield veto power over the Congress — such a situation would be quite undemocratic."

SRS_approach_tingkau_exiles_desc:0 "The deepwater harbour of Dinkau was first occupied by Imperial sailors whose ships had stopped at the harbour seeking refuge from a storm.

SRS_approach_hail_forest_communes_desc:0 "The sparsely-populated and undeveloped Hail Forest is home to dozens of autonomous communes, detached from the General Congress in New Skynavia and existing in a de-facto state of independence.

socrep_grif.1.d:0 "From all across the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, both urban centers and rural communities, if such terms can even be used for the frozen north, they gathered. Socialists, anarchists, communists and representatives of several other, more radical or unique leftist ideologies assembled in New Skynavia.\n\nA great task awaited these revolutionaries. The world continued to plunge deeper into the cold and cruel claws of monarchism, nationalism and of course, capitalism by the day. And thus, as the world kept becoming more and more hateful towards both them and their ideology, more drastic decisions than ever had to be taken and more drastic actions performed. \n\nHowever, there were difficulties agreeing on just what needs to be done. This was nothing new, as the two political factions of the Skynavian Socialist Republic: the Communalists and the Internationalists, while eager to participate in transforming the country into truly free and prosperous land, have had countless disagreements over how exactly such a process should be performed and have spent most of the Skynavian history being more occupied with their own endeavors both within the Socialist Republic and beyond it's borders instead of attempting to implement their ideals across the country.\n\nBut this time seems different from any similar attempts of getting these groups to collaborate which happened before. Due to the efforts of Asper Sickleclaw, however, both these groups have understood that in such a cruel and unforgiving age, coexistence and cooperation is the only way of survival."
socrep_grif.1.a:0 "Let's hope this works out."
socrep_grif.2.t:0 "Socialism and the Way we Live"
socrep_grif.2.d:0 "The Socialist Republic of Skynavia has already existed for several decades, yet we posses very few industrial centers and even those are greatly lacking. With our citizens possessing so few factories, our country is in a very dangerous position. Even in our current geographical position we are not only surrounded by more powerful enemies, but most of our history has been spent waging a war against the Northern Tribes for decades. If we wish to survive the coming decades, a large and modern industrial base is a necessity. However the revolutionaries of our republic do not wish to survive, they seek to liberate the all workers of Griffonia, a task which will require even greater industrial capacity. Thus we cannot limit our industrialization and risk not only everything we have achieved till this point, but also the free future of the workers of the world.\n\nWith the members of the Internationalist coalition providing such convincing arguments, the General Congress has decided to support the policies and laws on industrialization proposed by the association. With the enactment of this decision some limitations which were previously placed in order to limit expansion of production facilities will be removed. Furthermore the leadership of the country will invest in acquiring new and advanced machinery in order to improve production of both civilian produce and military equipment.\n\nHowever it seems that quite a few previous supporters of the Internationalists have criticized the, as they claim, rash and short-sighted, decisions and policies which they believe will eventually lead to ecological collapse which will doom the world."
socrep_grif.2.a:0 "There can be no Utopia in the future if one gives away the present."
socrep_grif.3.t:0 "Socialism and the Air we Breathe"
socrep_grif.3.d:0 "While the Socialist Republic of Skynavia has only existed for a few decades, one can already easily see the effects that hundreds of thousands of new inhabitants and the expansion and establishment of both new cities and centers of production had on the environment, especially the locations with most urbanization. Already there are some places with extremely fragile local ecosystems where the expansion of production facilities might lead to permanent damage. With such a crisis becoming a potential reality, the General Congress has decided that strict limitations and guidelines on how the process of industrial expansion should be performed in our country must be implemented. Furthermore this set of laws will not only limit industrialization, but will also reduce the amount of chaotic expansion that is currently happening in the few urban centers of our country. After all it's well know, even in the Frozen North, that modern cities have an extremely negative effect on the surrounding environment.\n\nOf course some internationalists opposed such a decision, claiming that by slowing down and limiting our industrialization we are weakening ourselves and thus endangering our freedom and independence. While many share similar fears, it was decided that it's better to risk the present than doom the future."

socrep_grif.4.d:0 "While the claims of the anarchists within the Communalist coalition that increased centralism, even if democratic, could very easily lead to entire groups lacking representation and the potential slow transformation of the system into a dictatorial one, were fears that many within the General Congress held themselves, it was still decided that while a direct democracy based on horizontal hierarchies is a goal that should be striven towards, the current era requires as much unity between the various political groups within the country as possible. This would be extremely difficult to accomplish with a system where even the concept of a "political party" is a foreign one. Furthermore while observing other revolutionary movements and states one can clearly see that sometimes a vertical hierarchy, even if partially contradictory to the idea of true equality between all creatures, is a necessity in order to create circumstances which would lead to an utopia in the future. Thus the ideas of Democratic Centralism will be implemented in the Socialist Republic of Skynavia.\n\nHowever, like many times before, various citizens and communities believe that our policies which are meant to give them a truly stable future, are nothing more than an attempt to gain power, and thus they have chosen to change the faction which they support."

Thus the system of direct democracy based on horizontal hierarchies which has already been used by some communes and collectives will be adapted and encouraged on a grander scale all across the Socialist Republic of Skynavia.\n\nOf course, like always there are many citizens who, while previously more inclined to support the Communalist coalition, are dissatisfied with the implementation of this new system and thus have decided to support the Internationalist faction instead."

Our citizens already posses freedoms which millions of workers and serfs enslaved by the bourgeoisie and tyrants to the south do not. Thus, with our position of power, it is our duty to bring liberty and freedom to those who are suffering from oppression across Griffonia and the world, even if we have to employ some measures which our opposition claims are authoritarian or statist. After all, if we wish to create an army strong enough for these wars of liberation and effectively work together with any other socialist states we will need a more centralized government, an internationalist vanguard around which a liberation of all workers can be organized.\n\nHowever, it seems that our decision to begin preparing for the upcoming world revolution has led to some communities which previously supported us loosing their faith in our goals as their freedoms, which they seem to have greatly appreciated, were limited by our decision to increase the size of our army and give more power to a central authority."

While our citizens already posses far more social and political freedoms than the oppressed workers and serfs of the tyrannies to the south, that is true, just being better than the worst is not a motivation to stop in our march towards a Libertarian Socialist Utopia. This is why the internationalists, while clearly motivated by the noble wish to liberate the millions of subjugated griffons who slave away, are clearly misguided. After all, how can we bring true liberty to the workers of the world if we ourselves don't truly follow our ideals?\n\nThus with this new stance taken, our republic will be even further decentralized, with the various communes and collectives receiving far more power in solving various local problems and enacting regional policies. Furthermore this will allow these local organizations to increase the size of the regional militias which will allow both these collectives and our republic to organize a better defense against any possible enemies.\n\nHowever, it seems that several of the communities which had previously supported our goal of a Libertarian Socialist Utopia, have been persuaded by the internationalist arguments and have embraced their goal of a world revolution."

Already, she was looking forward to school, not only because she would be seeing her friends, but also because classes were always enjoyable and engaging, although she always got splinters during the woodworking sessions, and found the political theory often being the topic of discussion in class complicated and complex.\n\nAlthough she may not have realised it at the time, Starflank would grow up having experienced the new socialist school curriculum implemented in the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, being educated into a member of the proletariat conscious and critical of the socialist governance at home, and the importance of the class struggle taking place in nations abroad."

However, as most of the country is comprised of frozen tundra, both communication between the various communities and enacting country-wide policies used to be difficult tasks. However the spreading of radio technology across the country, assisted by the central leadership, has allowed us to eliminate this problem as now every community can properly communicate with New Skynavia. This also allows the People's Councils to indirectly participate in making laws and enacting policies as they can now directly listen to how the General Council comes to it's decisions and how they are justified. One could claim that the entire populace of Socialist Republic of Skynavia is directly present at the debates which determine the future of the country.\n\nProviding every community with at least one radio has also created opportunities which weren't even thought about when the policy was being enacted. The most notable of these applications is using this new network which connects the entire country in order to improve the education of chicks and foals that live in the more remote regions."

This means that not all communes, collectives and cooperatives posses or lack access to any communal higher institutions of learning, thus thousands of Skynavian citizens lack the chance to access tertiary education. Not only does this limit the life opportunities of our citizens, but also negatively impacts the military, scientific and industrial capabilities of our country. Thus the General Congress, in a rare moment of complete agreement between the Internationalist and Communalist coalitions has decided to establish the greatest institution of higher education within our republic - The People's University of Skynavia. Any citizen of our republic will be allowed to attend this university, for free of course, and they will be provided with living quarters if they don't have a local location to stay. We will gather the best and most qualified specialists from both inside the republic and abroad in order to bring knowledge to the inquisitive citizens from all across the country.

With such a goal in mind it might seem strange for the General Congress, which is currently being comprised of mostly communalists, to decide that a country-wide network of railroads needs to be constructed. After all such a campaign would require great amounts of resources and could potentially result in substantial amounts of pollution being produced. However the benefits from this would greatly help in creating a sustainable and ecological system. Most importantly, this will provide the citizens of Skynavia the ability to traverse the country without having to rely on other, more polluting or dangerous ways of travelling across the frozen tundra. Furthermore it will allow easier transportation of modern equipment and machinery.

Thus the various collectives, communes and cooperatives scattered across the territories of the republic will be supplied with the most modern and numerous technology and equipment available. This will allow these communities, with some help from the central government in organizing such an endeavor, begin the long and difficult process of expanding the already existing industrial centers and establishment of new ones. However this long struggle will be worth it as it will improve not only the working conditions of native workers, but also the ones suffering abroad as this industry will serve in arming the soldiers who will be the instruments of their liberation."

If the revolution was to be a true revolution, it was incumbent upon its champions to rethink more than just systems of governance. \n\nHow did they view those who loved in non-traditional ways such as those who found love with another species, whether of not it produced an offspring? Did they cling to idea that relationships were strictly monogamous affairs? If a new world was truly to come, questions such as these would need to be answered.

All of this did very little to make the famous radical more charitable in his disposal and when an obstinate policegriffon questioned his papers Ponehon headbutted him unconscious before marching to the congress. \n\nIt was swiftly made clear that Ponehon's views had not softened during his years abroad, fighting in both Longsword and Prywhen, indeed they may well have been reinforced. He made it clear to the congress from the beginning that he would only accept any role that was bestowed on him by his fellow revolutionary fighters - the day he became a fat, commissioned  \"general\" that sat away from the front lines and above his fellow socialists was the day he swallowed a grenade. \n\nAll the same, though; he was happy to be back.

In the end though, nature won out when a sudden blast of wind tore his papers away and sent them flying. Beakunin's response was to sigh and depart for congress, waving to the somewhat befuddled crowd as he left.\n\nAt the congress the old revolutionary spoke of his journeys throughout Griffonia, including his experiences in Aquilea during the recent revolution.

The population has chafed under the increasingly brutal military dictatorship of Asper Sickleclaw, formerly an esteemed revolutionary war hero, now vilified as a reactionary and traitor to the Socialist Revolution.\n\nThe efforts of the military junta ruling over Skynavia to crush dissent and cement their regime have been harsh and suppressive, with many revolutionaries and activists being imprisoned, sent into exile, or even executed. For a while, it seemed that the people of Skynavia had accepted their lot in life, along with the military junta's narrative that the Socialist Revolution in Skynavia had failed its people.\n\nThis rather depressive view of things, however, would soon prove to be false, as in the early hours of the morning, a great crowd of griffons, ponies, and other creatures marched onto the building complex that formerly housed the General Congress of Skynavia. Demanding an end to Sickleclaw's dictatorial rule, the crowd was allowed to proceed unchallenged by sympathetic military units who had had enough of the authoritarian military regime. They successfully and safely reached the headquarters of Sickleclaw's regime, but were fired upon in an ambush by a cadre of officers loyal to Sickleclaw. The ensuring close-quarters combat, fought with paving stones and placards against rifles and a machine-gun emplacement, ended with the defeat of this last-ditch defence of the military regime.\n\nThe corpse of Sickleclaw, who had shot himself in his office, was retrieved and strung up on a lamppost, and the rest of his staff were imprisoned by the victorious revolutionaries, whilst army units elsewhere in the country were disarmed when the news of the successful revolt reached the rest of Skynavia.\n\nAs a successor to the defunct Socialist Republic of Skynavia, the Commune of Skynavia has arisen with the promise of a new era of libertarian and democratic Socialist governance."

Civilian authority is all but disbanded, except for where it serves as a convenient accessory to the military, and Sickleclaw now serves as Dictator of the Republic.\n\nOrder has finally been imposed on the nation through the only way that truly works, brute force, and it is kept in place through strict policing and unforgiving punishments. Despite this, however, there is neither time nor reason to relax. Socialism is an insidious thing and it can grow where you least expect it. Therefore, martial law will be extended indefinitely, until such a time that Sickleclaw deems it no longer necessary.\n\nAll is quiet in Skynavia. The military patrols pass unharassed through the capital city's neighbourhoods, even those which had once been hotbeds of radical socialist movements. The assembly halls are all boarded up; some have been repurposed as impromptu prisons by the military. The anarcho-primitivist communes deep within the Hail Forest have been rooted out and eradicated, their members scattered to the winds.\n\nBut the people of Skynavia remember. They remember life as it had been under the Socialist Republic. And they remember the lofty ideals of the International Socialist Revolution.\n\nIt might take years, or even decades, of struggle. But deep within the hearts of every creature in Skynavia, from the lowliest political dissident rotting in a prison cell, to Asper Sickleclaw himself, is the knowledge that the military regime will not last - someday, freedom and democracy shall return to the icy lands of Skynavia."

Only after a few months, almost every creature in Skynavia knew someone who had been snatched up by the secret police, and in too many cases, these people were never seen again.

Many congresspeople had brought this up before, but it never was addressed. To our delight, the people seem to have been of the same mind, and the vote was quick and unanimous."

socrep_grif.67.d:0 "The military has historically been the tool of the elite; from the knights who were given land in exchange for fealty to modern armies formed to carry out the orders of kings and presidents. It would be too easy to maintain this and view our army as a tool of the government, equally useful for repression as for defense, and that is why we must not take that path.\n\nThe soldier of the commonwealth will be entrusted with more than just marching and shooting a rifle, they will be given influence in accordance with their position, a voice in forming their chains of command and in where they march, the soldier who feels he has a stake in the fight fights the hardest, and we shall no bind our soldiers with propaganda villifying our enemies or whip them up into nationalist frenzies.

As we pride ourselves on a society built on scientific foundations, it goes without saying that the scientists should be given a say in its formation as well as in where their efforts will be spent.\n\nScience shall be democratized; the results they produce will be open for all to access and we will make sure that the greatest minds of our Commonwealth will not be kept from pursuing the truths because it was not felt the results would not be 'profitable' enough, and we will give openings for scientists who wish to pursue new venues of thinking that would run counter to established wisdom.

We must make sure that farmers are not dependent on certain crops to make ends meet, or forced to abandon their farms due to being run out of business. Instead, we shall make sure they are able to grow their crops or, if there's no need for them, they are given help in growing other things.

In the factories and dockyards, on the construction sites and in the mines, we will empower the common worker. They will have the voice to speak up and object when they are being worked to death, or when their managers tell them to do things that they know will end poorly. It should not be a revolutionary concept to truly take care of and listen to the common working class creature, and yet that's where we have been."

socrep_grif.71.d:0 ""Us" and "them" are one of the most fundamental - and thus most dangerous - divisions of the sapient creature's mind. It puts up barriers between creatures who share so much in common, barriers to which post-hoc justifications can be applied later. "They are workshy" or "they are violent" or simply "they are evil". Condemnation takes the place of understanding and sooner or later, you have a division that can cause outright wars; and all because you once would not call these creatures your brothers and sisters for whatever reason.\n\nWe cannot ever do away with this division fully, but we can aim to mitigate it. Terms like "Aquileian" or "Greifwalder" or "Wingbardian" will be relegated to the annals of history and we will, in all things, reject the very notion of a nation. If, one day, our children will treat wars between "nations" as just as inane as wars between villages or city blocks, then we will have succeeded in doing away with these mental chains that have caused so much misery and death."

We are no savages to burn down old temples, ban beloved holidays or belittle and insult that which has bound communities since ancient times. If we do that, we are no better than the worst imperialist.\n\nEmma Goldgriff has written much on this topic, and she says that above all else, we must find that which unites all creatures: things such as the celebration of birth, or remembering the dead, or the dawn of spring and the harvest times. We will work to bind all creatures together around such holidays. We must never coerce but instead entice and let everycreature, whether they are the first or last to participate, they should feel welcome and included as we let these cultures meet and mix to form something new and truly inclusive"

The cities cannot become isolated from the countryside that feeds it, and therefore provisions have been left in the constitution so that everycreature, no matter where, may take part in the most fundamental parts of the nation; the sustenance farming and resource extraction. Our dream is that all will be willing and able to participate in these industries, if nothing else to understand how hard the countryside works to feed a modern society.

Damaged in the devastating Prywhen Civil War, the ruined schoolhouse meant that the children of the surrounding villages had not been receiving a proper education.\n\nFrom time to time, a gaggle of such children would visit the construction workers, bringing them gifts of sweets, drinks, and food from their parents. Despite having been out of school for so long, their manners were still intact, it seemed. Nor was the thirst for learning inherent in all children missing, as the young griffons observed the work of the construction griffons, chattering amongst themselves and with the workers as the day progressed.\n\nThe schoolhouse would be fully rebuilt within a few days, and the children would once again become students, learning under the watchful tutelage of a volunteer teacher from Skynavia.\n\nAlthough there are still many other schoolhouses to be rebuilt, and a myriad of other societal ills plaguing the Pan-Griffonian Commonwealth that need solving. Cities and towns damaged by war need to be rebuilt, their surrounding fire-scorched farmlands revitalised, and the broken web of railroads linking all of Griffonia together restitched. The stalled industrialisation of Griffonia will have to be started anew, with proper care taken in respect to the natural environment and the creatures living within. But with each inch of progress gained through our hard work, the Commonwealth shall become more like the socialist utopia that the people of Griffonia deserve."

From low-caste Diamond Dog warlocks to unicorns who found themselves disgusted by the decadence of their fellow magic users, we have received magic users from all over the world who are now building a new revolutionary tradition where the fruits of magic will be something enjoyed by all creatures, as should be with all things in the world.

We cannot just move on, thinking that our comrades of the northern tribe will shrug and forget the pains of the war.\n\n All over the north, Skynavians have travelled, bringing food aplenty for the celebration ahead alongside entertainment. We will not force ourselves in though, if we truly are not welcome we leave the gifts and depart. In most cases though, our comrades greet us and let us inside to celebrate the last evening of the old year, and as another year slowly comes around it greets us all, together, with hopes for a better future for everycreature."

One is free to apply their natural initiative to work, their spontaneous creative energy, to whatever purpose they see fit - a luxury afforded to the people of Skynavia, whose talents are not in thrall to the coercive systems of wage labour, indentured servitude, or worse, slavery, in the capitalist countries. To further develop this philosophy, Communalist thinkers have called for the devolution of all menial labour to individual communities and households, so that all can shoulder the burden of the undesirable, yet necessary, work needed to keep society running - garbage collection, sanitation, cleaning and maintenance of public spaces, and the like. No longer shall there be a permanent underclass resigned to performing such drudgery on behalf of a thankless bourgeoisie, and all shall partake in the cultivation of their own living environments.\n\nOn the other hand, the foremost Internationalist ideologues have argued that we should instead focus our efforts on affirming the necessity of military service in the defense of the Skynavian homeland, with measures taken to appeal to the collectivist ethos adopted by the Skynavian people so as to compel the pacifists, individualist anarchists, and the detached commune-dwellers of the Republic to partake in a few years of military service, in the militias if not in the "professional" army.\n\nIt has now come to a vote in the General Congress.

But both factions remain resolute in their shared mission — that is, to strive for the full realisation of socialism wherever possible, and in achieving this goal they will work together in peace and harmony. Everyone hopes that the nascent General Congress will be up to the quite momentous task of providing genuine democratic governance to the people of Skynavia; the first session of the Congress was chaotic and raucous, as Internationalist and Communalist delegates orated, shouted, cheered and booed in a tumult of political discussion yet to be restricted by protocols and decorum.\n\nOf course, all this idealism is premised on the notion that Sickleclaw, when the time comes, will gracefully cede his authority to the General Congress.

The mood was amiable and cheerful, and the procession was a festive occasion rather than a restive one; after all, everyone expected Sickleclaw to cede power to the General Congress. To the people in the crowd, Skynavia seemed to be on the verge of greatness, where the newly-reconciled Internationalists and Communalists would work together in the General Congress towards a new era.\n\nFrom his office, Sickleclaw watches the procession.
